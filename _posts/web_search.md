# Do racial composition and political climate influence people's health literacy in the U.S.?
### Chen-Shuo Hong

### Significance: In the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, it has become important to promote [health literacy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0884-z) at the population level to stem the spread of the virus. However, not all behaviors that aim to contain the pandemic are welcome in the U.S. In fact, some types of behavior, such as wearing face masks, have been regarded as a stigma for [certain racial and ethnic groups](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/us/coronavirus-masks-racism-african-americans.html). Also, in some states [protesters publicly gathered](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/business/media/lockdown-protests-reporters.html) against the stay-at-home restrictions. COVID-19-related protective behavior is not only related to public health, but also tied to culture and politics.

In this post, I explore the associations between racial composition, political climate, and COVID-19-related behavior. I focus on three major behaviors: hand washing, face masks, and social distancing. Using survey and digital trace data, I show that people living in the U.S. are likely to pay attention to specific behavior based upon their living environments, such as racial compositions and political climates.

Figure 1 shows people’s interests on these three behaviors in the U.S. over a year. The higher the number of hits, the more popular the keyword. In February 2019, people began searching face masks when China reported more COVID-19 cases and deaths.

Social distancing became a popular keyword after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced its [social distancing recommendations in March](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/smarter-living/coronavirus-social-distancing.html). Then in early April, people again searched face masks when CDC incorporated face masks as part of its [guideline](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html). Interesting, face masks was the most popular keyword during the pandemic compared to social distancing and hand washing. I suspect that this phenomenon might be associated with race.

Figure 2. shows an interesting pattern of the relation between racial compositions and search behavior. Whereas the states which have larger White populations become aware of all three protective behaviors, those which have larger Black populations seem to search the terms less.  Asian population, in contrast, paid a lot of attention to face masks and social distancing. Although we cannot infer individual preferences based upon state-level data, my results demonstrate racial composition in a state may influence residents’ perception of risk and shape their online search behavior.

Political climate also shapes people’s perception of COVID-19 risk. Figure 3. illustrates how state-level political ideology correlates with online search. Compared to hand washing, face masks and social distancing are strongly negatively correlated with the proportion of conservative ideology in a state. That is, the more the residents hold conservative ideology, the less they search for keywords that include face masks and social distancing.

How to explain the correlation between racial composition, political climate, and COVID-19-related web-search behavior? There are several hypotheses. First, racial groups have unequal access to internet or digital devices. Recent [survey reports](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2018/acs/acs-39.html) find that compared to White and Asian households, households with a Black householder were the least likely to own or use computers or other digital devices. Without devices that can connect to the internet,  Black population may find it difficult to find information related to COVID-19 and thus have fewer opportunities to search protective strategies.

Second, whether wearing face masks or washing hands is part of [cultural norms](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/us/politics/coronavirus-white-house-face-masks.html?searchResultPosition=1). Different from the U.S., many Asian countries see wearing face masks as an effective protective strategy to contain the spread of COVID-19. Exposing the information from their original homes, Asian Americans and immigrants may be likely to search face masks as much as social distancing. In contrast, hand washing is more acceptable in the U.S. In fact, when the outbreak happened in January, most [opinions](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/opinion/coronavirus-prevention-tips.html) in the U.S. argue that people should wash their hands more frequently, rather than wearing face masks.  

Third, [recent studies](https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/the-relation-between-media-consumption-and-misinformation-at-the-outset-of-the-sars-cov-2-pandemic-in-the-us/) found that Republicans or those who have conservative political views were more likely to believe conspiracy theory, which claims that the CDC was overemphasizing the severity of the virus and aimed to attack President Donald Trump. As a result, we can expect to find that in those states which have more conservatives, residents searched all three protective behaviors much less.

In sum, my analysis illustrates that racial composition and political climates may contribute to people’s interests in COVID-19-related behavior, which may then shape the outcomes of the pandemic. Although the results do not identify the casual relationship as many other factors, such as local government’s policies, may also change people’s health literacy and awareness, it is important to ask why we observe such strong correlations among these factors. As a student of computational social science, combining digital trace and survey data provides us unprecedented opportunities to observe people’s behavior in large scale and engage in important debates over race, politics, and health.
