I am a sociologist at National Taiwan University (NTU). I spend most of my time conducting research. In particular, I am interested in how the relational processes (such as social connections or social capital) shape individual and population health. I am also interested in studying the interplay between culture and network structure to analyze the intergroup ties that in turn generate inequality. My methodological approach is theory-driven, with a preference for using unconventional data sources and dynamic analyses, leading me to adopt cutting-edge quantitative and computational methods. My work spans many kinds of data (for example, I've used adminstrative data, social media, longitudinal and cross-national surveys, survey experiments). My current research projects analyze intergroup dynamics, inequality, and social influence in networks within the areas of public health and social and economic inequality. At NTU, I also teach courses on research methods.

Before pursuing my PhD degree, I had two-year industrial experience of applying social network analysis at Deloitte Consulting in Taiwan. I am open to providing consulting services to any research projects where the goal is to create inclusive and equitable societies and improve people's well-being.
