I am a sociologist at National Taiwan University (NTU). I spend most of my time conducting research. My particular area of interest lies in understanding how relational processes (such as social connections or social capital) influence individual and population health outcomes. I am also interested in studying the interplay between culture and network structure to analyze the intergroup ties that contribute to the generation of inequality. My methodological approach is theory-driven, with a preference for using diverse data sources and dynamic analyses. This approach has led me to adopt cutting-edge quantitative and computational methods. My work spans many kinds of data (for example, I've used adminstrative data, social media, longitudinal and cross-national surveys, survey experiments). My current research projects analyze intergroup dynamics, inequality, and social influence in networks within the areas of public health and social and economic inequality. At NTU, I also teach courses on research methods.

Before pursuing my PhD degree, I had two-year industrial experience of applying social network analysis at Deloitte Consulting in Taiwan. I am open to providing consulting services to any research projects where the goal is to create inclusive and equitable societies and improve people's well-being.
