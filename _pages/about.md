I am a sociologist at National Taiwan University. I spend most of my time conducting research. In particular, I am interested in how the relational processes (such as social connections or social capital) shape individual and population health. I am also interested in studying the interplay between culture and network structure to analyze the intergroup ties that in turn generate inequality. I am usually driven by a theoretically-motivated empirical research question that I then investigate using cutting-edge quantitative methods. My work spans many kinds of data (like adminstrative data, social media, longitudinal and cross-national surveys, survey experiments). My current research projects analyze intergroup dynamics, inequality, and social influence in networks within the areas of public health and social and economic inequality. At National Taiwan University, I also teach courses on research methods.

Before pursuing my PhD degree, I had two-year industrial experience of applying social network analysis at Deloitte Consulting in Taiwan. I am open to providing consulting services to any research projects where the goal is to create inclusive and equitable societies and improve people's well-being.
